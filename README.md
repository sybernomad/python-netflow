# python-netflow

It takes an input pcap file as a command-line argument. It utilizes the `nfpcapd` tool to convert the input pcap file into multiple `nfcapd` files, which contain information about individual network flows. Each `nfcapd` file is then processed using the `nfdump` tool, which extracts flow-level information and outputs the data in JSON format. The script captures the JSON output for each `nfcapd` file and saves it to a dictionary, where the key is the `nfcapd` file name.

The primary tools utilized in the script are:
- `nfpcapd`: This tool is used to convert the pcap file into `nfcapd` files, which organize the captured network flows.
- `nfdump`: This tool processes the `nfcapd` files and extracts detailed flow-level information. It is executed with the `-o json` flag to output the data in JSON format.

The output data in JSON format represents the flow-level information for each network flow captured in the input pcap file. It includes details such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, packet and byte counts, timestamps, and other relevant information. The specific fields and values in the JSON output depend on the characteristics of the captured network flows in the pcap file.

The purpose of nfdump is to analyze and process NetFlow data. NetFlow is a network protocol that collects information about network traffic flows, such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, packet counts, byte counts, timestamps, and more.

nfdump is a command-line tool that takes as input the nfcapd files generated by nfpcapd or other NetFlow data sources. It parses and processes the flow data, providing various options to filter, aggregate, and format the information for analysis and monitoring purposes.

## netflow

NetFlow is a network protocol that allows network administrators to gain visibility and insights into network traffic. It works by collecting and analyzing information about network flows, which are streams of packets sharing common characteristics. NetFlow-enabled devices capture traffic data and export it in the form of NetFlow records. This data provides valuable information about network usage
